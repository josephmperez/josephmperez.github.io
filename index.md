## Welcome to Joseph's Page

I will use this page for displaying working projects to students and the world to see.

I hope to share some gaming code, and use my own scripts for to use with current [games](https://josephmperez.github.io.games.html). I will see what langauges I can demonstrate with github with the different web pages that I create.

### Markdown

I hope to master this markdown to show different languages. Let's try Hello, World.

#### C'#'
```c#
// Hello.cs
publc class Hello
  {
    public static void Main()
    {
      System.Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
  }
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/josephmperez/josephmperez.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
